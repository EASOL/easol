# EASOL

EASOL helps teachers and school leaders bring their favorite educational technologies together onto one platform so that they can optimize learning. Educators can choose to integrate various data sources and blended learning tools so that they "talk" to one another and, therefore, allow them to get the most out of these systems. Itâ€™s all about making the use of educational technology easier and more powerful. What will you create on your EASOL?

EASOL is based from the Ed-Fi Alliance common data model.
