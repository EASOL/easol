# EASOL Dashboard

## Overview

EASOL helps teachers and school leaders bring their favorite educational technologies together onto one platform so that they can optimize learning. Educators can choose to integrate various data sources and blended learning tools so that they "talk" to one another and, therefore, allow them to get the most out of these systems. Itâ€™s all about making the use of educational technology easier and more powerful.

The EASOL Dashboard is a user interface to view information stored within the common data store.

The EASOL development team includes teachers, school leaders, data specialists and software engineers. Each element of the system is piloted in real classrooms so that we can get on-the-ground, real world feedback to inform the kind and format of educational technologies included in EASOL.
